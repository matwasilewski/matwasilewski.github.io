Welcome to my digital garden.

My name is Mateusz Wasilewski and I am currently based in London.
I am a Data Scientist working at the intersection of biology, mathematics and computer science.

This is my plot of land on the internet where I share my thoughts, code, interesting articles and useful tools.
