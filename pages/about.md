Welcome to my digital garden.

My name is Mateusz Wasilewski and I am currently based in London, United Kingdom. 
I am a Data Scientist working at the intersection of biology, mathematics and computer science.

My primary interests are:
- Natural Language Processing
- Graph Databases
- Python
- Drug Discovery
- Precision Medicine
- Statistics
- Bioinformatics
- Quantative finance
- Writing beautiful and clean code.

This is my piece of the internet where I share my thoughts, code, interesting articles and useful tools.
